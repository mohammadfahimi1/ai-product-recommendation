## 🧠 AI Feature Used

This app uses a **basic rule-based recommendation system**.  
Based on the user’s selected preferences (category and budget), it filters and recommends 3–5 matching products.

There is no external AI/ML model involved — logic is implemented in JavaScript using conditions and filtering.

## 🛠 Tools / Libraries Used

## 📌 Notable Assumptions
